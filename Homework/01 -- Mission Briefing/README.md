# HW Week 1 Day 1

## Mission Briefing

Good afternoon agent. This mission will be quite taxing, but you will make your country proud if you complete it. Your job is to create an app to brief future agents on mission details securely and privately. We know this is your first assignment, but be aware that this is a top priority for the agency. The Director herself will be watching the outcome of this assignment, so stay sharp.

Included with this brief is a zipped file containing the agency's efforts so far regarding this mission. It is a good start, but several key issues have not yet been solved. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to finish the tasks outlined in the attached source code and deliver the project for submission to all our field agents. Good luck.

Some additional tips regarding the storyboard:

* The button should really say "Authenticate"
* The textfield should have placeholder text that says "Agent name"
* Each UI element will need to be connected to its associated property in the ViewController class.
